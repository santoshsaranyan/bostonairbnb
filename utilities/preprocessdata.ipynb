Longwood Medical Area and Harvard Medical School are a 20 minute ride from the end of the street, or a pleasant 40 minute walk.  Angell Memorial is a 15 minute walk. Walk to many fabulous restaurants, or if you prefer to cook, get your ingredients at Wholefoods, only 7 minutes away by foot.  Jamaica Pond is perfect for a run or stroll and slightly farther on you can lose yourself in Harvard's Arnold Arboretum and Franklin Park.",

Walk to area attractions. Spend a busy day sightseeing in the city and return each evening to the peacefulness of being on the water. Sip a cocktail on one of two decks and watch the boats in the harbor.  Be rocked to sleep each night.",
         "The location is quiet, residential in nature. The harbor walk is steps away.  Thomas Menino Park is next to the marina with great skyline views and children's playground. we are a block from Spaulding rehab.  You can escape from the frenetic pace of downtown in the evening and enjoy solitude on the boat.",

         "A unique find - at home in Boston's hippest neighborhood. You'll enjoy an actual home with a deck, patio and garden for your kids to run around in. Such privacy in the center of Boston is quite rare.  It's a short trip from the airport and close to the center of town and public transportation.",
         "People want to live and visit Jamaica Plain because it has a hip vibe, is close to downtown, and has the most parks in the entire metropolitan area. My house is on a short two block street with primarily row houses.  It's at the foot of Sumner Hill which is filled with Victorian Mansions. It's fun to stroll around and imagine upper class life in the late 1800's. There is also a house dating from the 1700's on the main drag - Center Street.  That's where the action is and it's only a 5 minute walk from my house.  The Arnold Arboretum and Franklin Park total over 500 acres of open space and are less than a 10 minute walk. They are part of the Emerald .Necklace Greenway which was designed by Olmstead - who also designed Central Park. The wonderful lake, Jamaica Pond, is also nearby.  Most of my guests love to take a walk or run in the Arboretum.",

         "Hello!  I'm a Texas native that hasn't lost my \"ya'll\" even though I've lived in Boston for over 20 years. I spend most of my time outdoors - enjoying my garden, walking in nearby nature preserves, going on long,long bike rides, and escaping to the beach. I actually love winter because I ski in the parks near my house every day when there's snow on the ground.  It's a great way to exercise my dog, Lulu. I'm a political liberal, inveterate traveler and amateur classical musician though I love music of all sorts. I've loved being an airbnb host because I meet so many great people from all over the world.  I am happy to give you tips about Boston and spend time on the deck together.  I'm also happy to remain unobtrusive.  I look forwarding hosting you.   ",

It's fun to stroll around and imagine upper class life in the late 1800's. There is also a house dating from the 1700's on the main drag - Center Street.  That's where the action is and it's only a 5 minute walk from my house.  The Arnold Arboretum and Franklin Park total over 500 acres of open space and are less than a 10 minute walk.

Forest Hills, a stunningly landscaped cemetery full of history, makes a lovely walk/jog. e.e. cummings is buried there! <br /><br />***Please note that this room is quite small. I've recently decreased the maximum number of guests to one, in spite of the fact that many, many couples have enjoyed staying here.
